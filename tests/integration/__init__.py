"""
Integration tests for YouTube Frame Extractor.

This package contains tests that validate the end-to-end functionality
of the CLI commands (browser extraction, download extraction, batch processing,
and VLM-based analysis). These tests use temporary directories and Typer's CliRunner
to simulate real-world usage without affecting your local environment.
